# Iron Fish Bridge Demo

## ⚠️ This is for a hackathon only — it is NOT for any production use at all

This project is for the sole purpose of demonstrating bridging assets to/from Iron Fin and an EVM chain (in this case Sepolia). It is being open sourced for the Circuit Breaker hackathon. It is not an actual bridge that should ever be used in production. It set up to work with Iron Fish Skynet testnet and Sepolia.
